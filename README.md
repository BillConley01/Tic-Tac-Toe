# Tik-Tak-Toe
A responsive Tic Tac Toe Game Using React
<p>This is the code for a basic Tic Tac Toe game made with React. It originated from an assignment in Week #16 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to demonstrate the ability to communicate between parent and child components and add features.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>React state and callbacks are used to communicate between parent and child components of the game.</li>
<li>React is used to maintain current player and an array of game state properties.</li>
<li>Styling is spearated from the code with a cascading style sheet.</li>
<li>Grid layout is used for the layout of the game board.</li>
</ol>
